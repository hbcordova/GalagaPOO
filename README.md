# GAMEPLAY: Galaga in C++
**About the project:** This game was made as the final project of programming course 1 of the software engineering degree.

## About the game

Galaga is a classic arcade video game in which the player controls a spacecraft and must face waves of alien enemies. The objective of the game is to achieve the highest score possible by eliminating all the enemies.

The player must move the ship from left to right and shoot the enemies with the fire button. Enemies appear in formations and move predictably, so the player must anticipate their movements and shoot accurately to avoid being eliminated.

Occasionally, the player may face boss levels that are more difficult to defeat and require a different strategy. Additionally, there are special objects that can be collected to increase the score or improve the ship.

The game has multiple levels and the difficulty increases as the player advances. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest score possible and enter the list of top players.

> This project is inspired by the real game Galaga, so we tried to develop most of the game's features.
